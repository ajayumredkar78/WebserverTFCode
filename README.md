Sure! Here's a simple explanation of what this Terraform code does:

1. **Creating a Virtual Network (VPC):**
   - A new virtual network called `demo_vpc` is created with a range of IP addresses from `10.0.0.0` to `10.0.255.255`. This is like setting up a private, isolated section of a larger network where you can place your resources.

2. **Setting Up an Internet Gateway:**
   - An internet gateway called `gw` is created and attached to the `demo_vpc`. This gateway allows resources within the VPC to communicate with the internet.

3. **Creating a Route Table:**
   - A route table named `route_table` is created for the VPC. This route table has a rule that directs all outbound traffic (`0.0.0.0/0` means "anywhere on the internet") to go through the internet gateway.

4. **Creating a Subnet:**
   - A subnet called `my_subnet` is created within the VPC. Think of a subnet as a smaller network within your larger virtual network. This subnet uses the IP range `10.0.1.0` to `10.0.1.255` and is located in the availability zone `us-east-1a`.

5. **Associating the Subnet with the Route Table:**
   - The subnet `my_subnet` is linked to the route table `route_table`, which ensures that resources in this subnet follow the routing rules defined in the route table.

6. **Setting Up a Security Group:**
   - A security group named `instance_sg` is created to control traffic to and from resources within the VPC. It allows:
     - Inbound SSH traffic (port 22) from anywhere.
     - Inbound HTTP traffic (port 80) from anywhere.
     - Inbound HTTPS traffic (port 443) from anywhere.
     - All outbound traffic (all ports) to go anywhere.

7. **Launching a Web Server Instance:**
   - An instance (virtual machine) named `webserver` is launched using an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) identified by `ami-053b0d53c279acc90`. This instance is a `t2.micro` type and uses an SSH key named `terrakey`.
   - This instance is located in the subnet `my_subnet` and the availability zone `us-east-1a`.
   - When the instance starts, a script runs to:
     - Update the system packages.
     - Install the Apache web server.
     - Start the Apache web server.
     - Create a simple web page with the message "Congratulations! on your first Webserver Installation."

8. **Outputting the Public IP:**
   - Finally, the code outputs the public IP address of the `webserver` instance, which you can use to access the web server from the internet.

In summary, this Terraform script sets up a basic infrastructure on AWS: a virtual network, an internet gateway, a subnet, security rules, and a virtual machine running a web server.
